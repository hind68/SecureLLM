# Secure LLM DLP Service

Local FastAPI service for detecting and masking sensitive data before it is later connected to the Secure LLM Gateway flow.

This version uses a hybrid detector:

- Microsoft Presidio Analyzer with spaCy models for French and English.
- Custom Moroccan recognizers for CIN, Moroccan phones, IBAN/RIB and BIC/SWIFT.
- Custom recognizers and regex rules for technical secrets such as API keys, JWTs, private keys and hardcoded passwords.
- Existing regex validators for structured values, including Luhn for credit cards and MOD-97 for IBAN.

Arabic is limited in this MVP: OCR can use Arabic Tesseract and regex rules still run on Arabic text, but Arabic NER is not supported and Arabic text is not sent through the French spaCy model.

## Endpoints

- `GET /health`
- `GET /ready`
- `POST /analyse`
- `POST /analyse-image`
- `POST /analyse-pdf`
- `POST /analyse-file`
- `POST /analyse-message`

Typical response:

```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "decision": "MASK",
  "flagged": true,
  "highest_severity": "medium",
  "masked_text": "Mon adresse est [EMAIL_1]",
  "matches": [
    {
      "id": "email_1",
      "type": "email",
      "start": 16,
      "end": 34,
      "score": 0.8,
      "severity": "medium",
      "source": "regex"
    }
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

Sensitive values are not returned in `matches` and must not be written to logs. Only `masked_text` may contain the redacted form of submitted content.

## Decisions

Temporary MVP policy:

- no detection: `ALLOW`
- low or medium detection: `MASK`
- high detection: `BLOCK`
- extraction or analysis error: `BLOCK`

Fail closed is intentional: content that cannot be safely analysed is blocked.

## Supported Inputs

- Plain text and common source/config text files.
- PDF with text extraction and OCR fallback.
- Images through Tesseract OCR.
- DOCX, PPTX, CSV, XLSX.
- ZIP archives with path traversal, size, depth, file count, compression-ratio and encrypted-entry protections.

## Limits

Configured through environment variables:

| Variable | Default |
|---|---:|
| `DLP_MAX_TEXT_LENGTH` | `50000` |
| `DLP_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` | `20` |
| `DLP_MAX_ATTACHMENTS` | `10` |
| `DLP_MAX_ZIP_UNCOMPRESSED_MB` | `50` |
| `DLP_MAX_ZIP_FILES` | `50` |
| `DLP_MAX_ZIP_DEPTH` | `3` |
| `DLP_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` |

## Local Run

Install dependencies and spaCy models:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m spacy download fr_core_news_sm
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Tesseract must be installed locally for OCR endpoints. The Docker image installs English, French and Arabic OCR data.

## Docker

From the project root:

```bash
docker compose build dlp-service
docker compose up -d dlp-service
```

The container downloads spaCy models during image build. It does not need internet access at runtime.

Service URLs:

- host machine: `http://localhost:8000`
- Docker network: `http://dlp-service:8000`

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Current Limits

This is not a production banking DLP system. Presidio and custom rules improve coverage but do not guarantee perfect detection. Moroccan rules are custom MVP rules and must be reviewed with real compliance/security requirements before production use.
